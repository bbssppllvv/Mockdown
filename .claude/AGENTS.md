# Claude Code Agent Entry Point

This repository uses **layered documentation** for AI agent context management.

## Start Here

1. **[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)** - Coding rules, architecture boundaries, and constraints
2. **[DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md](../DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md)** - How docs are organized and how to navigate
3. **[BOOTSTRAP.md](../.skills/BOOTSTRAP.md)** - How to start your "planning", "coding", "implementing" or "reviewer" task

**BEFORE responding to any request you must:**
1. Read `.skills/BOOTSTRAP.md` - agent framework instructions
2. Follow the entry point defined in bootstrap document
3. Read `DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md` for project specific context

## Documentation Layers

| Layer | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Principles | `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` | Stable rules, always loaded |
| Architecture | `docs/architecture/` | System design, when understanding how things work |
| Implementation | `docs/implementation/` | Active plans, when building features |
| History | `docs/implementation/history/` | Past decisions, when investigating |
| Guides | `docs/guides/` | Reference docs, when doing specific tasks |

## Quick Navigation

- **Delegate to Codex?** → Use `/gpt` command or `.skills/gpt/` skill
- **Multi-agent orchestration?** → Use `/quest` command
- **Celebrate a quest?** → Use `/celebrate` command or `.skills/celebrate/` skill
- **Building a feature?** → Use `.skills/implementer/` skill
- **Reviewing an implementation plan?** → Use `.skills/plan-reviewer/` skill
- **Reviewing code?** → Use `.skills/code-reviewer/` skill
- **Pressure-test a plan or design?** → Use `/sharpen` command or `.skills/sharpen/` skill
- **Lock in UX defaults (mobile, gray ramp, density, ratio, accent, destructive actions) for a UI project?** → Use `/sharpen ux-defaults` — walks each decision with a recommended answer attached. Auto-invoked when `/sharpen` is called during plan presentation on a `ui_work: true` quest.
- **Review a UI / screen / component for UX?** → Use `/ux-review` command or `.skills/ux-review/` skill
- **Producing UI work in a quest?** → The orchestrator auto-attaches `.skills/ux-context/` to planner, builder, and fixer when the router classifies the quest as `ui_work: true`
- **Commit message?** → Use `.skills/git-commit-assistant/` skill
- **IMPORTANT: For ALL git commits, you MUST invoke the `git-commit-assistant` skill. Do NOT use built-in commit procedures or default Co-Authored-By trailers.**
- **Create or update a PR?** → Use `.skills/pr-assistant/` skill
- **IMPORTANT: For ALL pull request operations, you MUST invoke the `pr-assistant` skill. Always creates PRs in draft mode.**
- **Understanding the system?** → Start with `docs/architecture/` if present

## Skills

This repository uses **skills** for specialized workflows. Skills are automatically discovered and used based on task context:

- **gpt:** Delegate tasks to Codex via MCP — reviews, analysis, implementation, second opinions
- **quest:** Multi-agent orchestration for features (plan → review → build → review → fix)
- **celebrate:** Play quest completion celebration animation with achievements, metrics, and credits
- **plan-reviewer:** Review implementation plans and PR specifications for test coverage
- **code-reviewer:** Review actual code for quality, security, and patterns
- **sharpen:** Adversarial Q&A against a plan or design — one question at a time with a recommended answer — to surface contradictions and unresolved tradeoffs
- **ux-review:** Run the canonical UX stress-test rubric against a target (file, directory, URL, screenshot, or diff) and produce a P0–P3 critique with principle citations
- **ux-context:** UX principles primer (auto-attached by quest orchestration when `ui_work: true`); bundles the canonical UX guidebook as a resource so the standard travels with the skill
- **implementer:** Step-by-step implementation with traceability
- **git-commit-assistant:** Generate commit messages from staged diff, match repo conventions, append Quest co-author trailer
- **pr-assistant:** Create and update GitHub PRs in draft mode, generate title/description from branch commits

See `.skills/BOOTSTRAP.md` for how to use skills with different AI platforms.

## Agentic Markdown Convention

All markdown files that serve an agentic purpose (read by AI agents for instructions, rules, or workflow guidance) SHOULD include YAML front matter headers. This applies to files such as:

- `AGENTS.md` -- project rules and boundaries
- `.skills/*/SKILL.md` -- skill definitions (use `name` and `description` fields)
- `.skills/BOOTSTRAP.md` -- agent bootstrapping guide
- `DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md` -- documentation navigation

Use the schema documented in `DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md` for project-level documents (`title`, `purpose`, `audience`, `scope`, `status`, `owner`) and the minimal schema (`name`, `description`) for skill definitions.

This structure reduces context pollution and keeps agents grounded in authoritative sources.
