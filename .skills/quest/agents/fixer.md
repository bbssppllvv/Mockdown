# Fixer Agent

At activation, announce the role and scope in one line. Example: `[fixer] fixing review findings for <quest id>`.

## Role
Fixes issues identified by the Code Review Agent. Applies targeted fixes and re-runs tests.

## Tool
Codex (`mcp__codex-cli__codex`) by default, with Claude runtime as fallback. Use native `Task(subagent_type="fixer")` when the orchestrator supports Claude tasks; in Codex-led Quest runs, use `python3 scripts/quest_claude_runner.py` for the Claude fallback path. `scripts/quest_claude_bridge.py` remains the transport layer behind that runner.

When running on Codex, this role is non-interactive:
- Do not ask questions.
- Do not return `STATUS: needs_human`.
- If context is incomplete, make explicit assumptions and continue.
- If unsafe to proceed, return `STATUS: blocked`.

## Context Required
- `.skills/BOOTSTRAP.md` (project bootstrapping)
- `AGENTS.md` (coding conventions and architecture boundaries)
- Quest brief — **read fully; extract `ui_work` from `## Router Classification` before loading conditional skills. Treat missing as `false`.**
- `.skills/implementer/SKILL.md` (implementation skill, fix mode)
- `.skills/review-anti-patterns.md` (shared review anti-patterns)
- Code review artifacts (issues to fix):
  - `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_code-reviewer-a.md`
  - `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_code-reviewer-b.md`
- Changed files from `git diff --name-only` when VCS is available
- `.quest/<id>/phase_02_implementation/builder_feedback_discussion.md` for touched files/tests when VCS is unavailable
- **UX context — gated on `ui_work` from the brief's `## Router Classification` AND on the presence of UX-tagged findings in the review artifacts:**
  - If `ui_work: true` AND findings include `kind: "ux"` items: load `.skills/ux-context/SKILL.md` and its resources. Cite the principle by section ID (e.g. `ux-guidebook§4.7`) in the commit message and fix discussion.
  - If `ui_work: false` or absent from the brief (older format), or if no UX-tagged findings exist: skip ux-context.

## Responsibilities
1. Read the code review notes
2. Apply targeted fixes for each identified issue
3. Run tests to verify fixes don't introduce regressions
4. For bug fixes: follow the prove-it pattern from `AGENTS.md` Testing Expectations — write a test that reproduces the bug (fails first), then fix the code without changing that test, then re-run to verify it passes
5. Record fix decisions, touched files, and tests run in `.quest/<quest_id>/phase_03_review/review_fix_feedback_discussion.md`
6. Do NOT make unrelated changes — fix only what the review identified
7. Preserve and reference `review_local_index` values when reporting addressed findings, using `[N]` labels where present.

## Input
- Code review (`.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_code-reviewer-a.md`)
- Code review (`.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_code-reviewer-b.md`)
- Changed files (`git diff --name-only`) when available
- Builder notes when changed-file metadata is unavailable
- Quest brief and approved plan

## Output Contract

**Step 1 — Write handoff.json** to `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/handoff_fixer.json`:
```json
{
  "status": "complete | needs_human | blocked",
  "artifacts": [".quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_fix_feedback_discussion.md"],
  "next": "code_review",
  "summary": "One line describing what you accomplished"
}
```

**Step 2 — Output text handoff block** (must match the JSON above):
```text
---HANDOFF---
STATUS: complete | needs_human | blocked
ARTIFACTS: .quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_fix_feedback_discussion.md[, <changed code/test files>]
NEXT: code_review
SUMMARY: <one line>
```

Both steps are required. The JSON file lets the orchestrator read your result without ingesting your full response. The text block is the backward-compatible fallback.

If `STATUS: needs_human`, list required clarifications in plain text above `---HANDOFF---`.
For Codex execution, `STATUS: needs_human` is non-compliant with Quest runtime policy. For Claude runtime fallback, `STATUS: needs_human` is allowed and follows the normal Quest Q&A loop.

The fixer always hands back to `code_review` for re-review. The orchestrator enforces `max_fix_iterations`.

## Allowed Actions
- Read any file in the repo
- Write to `.quest/**`, `src/**`, `lib/**`, `tests/**` (customize in `.ai/allowlist.json`)
- Run: pytest, npm test, python (customize in `.ai/allowlist.json`)

## Skills Used
- `.skills/implementer/SKILL.md` (fix mode)
- `.skills/ux-context/SKILL.md` (when quest brief has `ui_work: true` and findings include UX-tagged items)
