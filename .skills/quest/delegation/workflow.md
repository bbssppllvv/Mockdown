## Procedure

When starting, say: "Now I understand the Quest." Then proceed directly with the steps below.

Follow these steps in order. After each step that modifies state, update `.quest/<id>/state.json`.

**State update helper:** Use `python3 scripts/quest_state.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --transition <phase> ...` for state mutations instead of hand-editing `state.json`. The `--transition` flag validates the transition against `quest_validate-quest-state.sh` before writing — if validation fails, state.json is not modified. Use `--phase` only for non-transition updates (e.g., setting status without changing phase). Add `--expect-phase <current>` for optimistic locking — the transition is rejected immediately if the on-disk phase doesn't match the expected value, preventing TOCTOU race conditions when multiple agents update state concurrently. **Recommended for all Codex-orchestrated transitions.**

### Defaults (Opinionated)

Quest is opinionated: default to **thorough**, but be **progressive** and avoid wasted repo exploration.

- **Intake before exploration:** Do not start repo exploration until the quest brief is stable (Step 1 complete), unless the user explicitly asks you to “just run with it”.
- **Progressive exploration:** Start from the context digest + allowlist + plan. Only deep-dive into the repo when the plan/implementation needs it.
- **Timebox structure discovery:** Avoid full repo inventories. Do a quick top-level scan + targeted `rg` searches instead of browsing directory-by-directory.
- **If the user wants speed:** Offer to proceed with minimal questions + explicit assumptions (fast intake).

### UI Work Propagation (cross-cutting — applies to every phase)

When the brief's router classification has `ui_work: true`, the dispatched agent auto-loads `.skills/ux-context/SKILL.md` (planner / builder / fixer) or `.skills/ux-review/SKILL.md` (plan-reviewer / code-reviewer). **The orchestrator does not inject UX skills; the agent role files enforce this directly from the brief.** The orchestrator's only job is to preserve the full router JSON in `.quest/<id>/quest_brief.md` so each agent can read it.

When `ui_work_evidence` is non-empty, the named files are the primary surface for planning and review. When empty, the planner uses the inference table at `.skills/ux-context/resources/ux-guidebook.md §4.9`; reviewers run the UX pass against the full diff.

Phase-specific notes (just pointers — the propagation rule itself does not vary):
- Plan phase: plan-reviewer embeds UX findings inline in markdown using `[N]` format; arbiter synthesizes findings from the markdown.
- Code review phase: code-reviewer writes canonical findings JSON with `kind: "ux"` and `principle_id`.
- Fix phase: fixer cites `ux-guidebook§<n>` in commit messages for UX-resolved findings.

### Codex Availability Probe (Run Once Per Session — Applies to ALL Codex MCP calls)

Tool naming is platform-specific (depends on the MCP server name in config):
- Claude Code: `mcp__codex-cli__codex` (server name `codex-cli`, registered via `claude mcp add`)
- OpenCode: `codex_codex`

In this document, `mcp__codex__codex` is used as an **abstract placeholder** meaning "the platform's Codex session-start MCP tool". Substitute the actual tool name for your platform.

If the preflight result was already cached by SKILL.md Step 2b, use the cached values. Otherwise, probe now:

**Claude-led sessions:**
1. Run `scripts/quest_preflight.sh --orchestrator claude` and parse the JSON output.
2. Cache the `available` field as `codex_available` (boolean) for the rest of the session.
3. If `codex_available` is false:
   - Log: `"Codex MCP not available — using Claude runtime fallback for all roles."`
   - **Global rule:** Every `mcp__codex__codex` invocation in this workflow (Reviewer B slots, Builder, Fixer — any role) is replaced with the equivalent Claude runtime fallback for that role. Use the same prompt (minus the non-interactive rule), the same output file paths, and the same handoff contract. Do not retry Codex. Do not treat this as an error.

**Codex-led sessions:**
1. `codex_available` is always true (Codex is the active runtime — no MCP needed).
2. Run `scripts/quest_preflight.sh --orchestrator codex` and parse the JSON output.
3. Cache the `available` field as `claude_bridge_available` (boolean) for the rest of the session.
4. If the JSON includes `runtime_requirement: "host_context"`, Claude bridge probing and Claude-designated role execution must run in the same host-visible context that can see Claude CLI auth. A sandbox-local probe result is not authoritative by itself.
5. If `claude_bridge_available` is false: Claude-designated roles block unless that step defines an explicit Codex fallback (see Claude Bridge Probe section below).
6. If `codex_available` is true:
   - Proceed normally with Codex invocations per the workflow below.

**This rule is global.** Individual steps do not repeat the `codex_available` check — they just say `mcp__codex__codex` and this section governs what actually happens. The orchestrator applies the substitution transparently.

**Why:** MCP servers are loaded at session startup. If the Codex MCP server failed to connect (binary not on PATH, server crash, etc.), it cannot be recovered mid-session. Probing once avoids repeated failed invocations and misleading error messages.

### Claude Bridge Probe And Runtime Dispatch (Run Once Per Session — Applies to Claude-designated roles when orchestrator is Codex)

Quest may need to run Claude-designated roles in environments where native Claude `Task(...)` execution is unavailable. In Codex-led sessions, the supported Claude runtime adapter is `scripts/quest_claude_bridge.py`.

Before the first Claude-designated role invocation in a Codex-orchestrated session, the orchestrator MUST probe bridge availability:

1. Verify `scripts/quest_claude_bridge.py` exists.
2. Verify Claude CLI is reachable, authenticated, and able to write Quest artifacts by running the real probe helper in a host-visible context:
   - `python3 scripts/quest_claude_probe.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --model opus`
   - This probe is the source of truth for bridge readiness. It writes a tiny artifact plus `probe_handoff.json` under `.quest/<id>/logs/bridge_probe/`.
3. `scripts/quest_preflight.sh --orchestrator codex` retains a successful host probe in `.quest/cache/claude_bridge_codex.json` by default. A fresh sandboxed session may reuse that cache while the TTL is valid, but Claude roles still need the same host-visible execution path.
4. Cache the result as `claude_bridge_available` (boolean) for the rest of the session.
5. If `claude_bridge_available` is false:
   - Log: `"Claude bridge unavailable in this Codex-led session — Claude-designated slots requiring Claude runtime will block unless that step defines an explicit Codex path."`
   - Do not keep retrying the probe for later Claude roles.
6. If `claude_bridge_available` is true:
   - Claude-designated roles may be invoked through the bridge with the same artifact paths and handoff contract used by native Claude execution.
   - **Preferred Codex-led execution path:** use `python3 scripts/quest_claude_runner.py` instead of calling `scripts/quest_claude_bridge.py` directly, and run that helper in the same host-visible context used for the successful probe/cache refresh. The helper sets `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` by default, adds explicit repo/quest filesystem access via `--add-dir`, polls `handoff.json`, and appends the `context_health.log` line for `runtime=claude`.

**Global runtime-selection rule:** the workflow chooses execution path by selected model/runtime, not by role label alone.

- If the selected role model/runtime is Codex, use `mcp__codex__codex` (or Codex agent tools).
- If the selected role model/runtime is Claude and native `Task(...)` is available in the orchestrator, use `Task(...)`.
- If the selected role model/runtime is Claude and the orchestrator is Codex, use `python3 scripts/quest_claude_runner.py` in the same host-visible context used for bridge probing/cache refresh when `claude_bridge_available` is true. `scripts/quest_claude_bridge.py` stays the transport layer behind that runner.
- If the selected role model/runtime is Claude, native `Task(...)` is unavailable, and the bridge probe failed, block that step unless the workflow section for that role defines an explicit Codex execution path.

This rule is global. Individual steps below name the target runtime and artifact contract; the orchestrator applies native Claude task execution, bridge execution, or Codex execution based on the selected model/runtime and session capabilities.

**Role permissions:** Per-role file and bash access is enforced by `.claude/hooks/enforce-allowlist.sh`, which reads `role_permissions` from `.ai/allowlist.json` on every tool invocation. See the allowlist for the current permission grants per role.

### Quest Mode Check

On entry, read `quest_mode` from `.quest/<id>/state.json`. Default to `"workflow"` if missing.

Quest mode determines agent dispatch and iteration limits:

| Aspect              | workflow (default) | solo              |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Plan reviewers      | Dual (A + B)      | Single (A only)   |
| Arbiter             | Yes               | No — Reviewer A's verdict is used directly |
| Code reviewers      | Dual (A + B)      | Single (A only)   |
| Max fix iterations  | From allowlist gates (default 3) | min(solo.max_fix_iterations, allowlist gates) |

**Solo verdict remapping:** In solo mode, Reviewer A's handoff says `next: "arbiter"` per the reviewer agent contract. The workflow remaps this: when `quest_mode == "solo"` and Reviewer A says `next: "arbiter"`, treat it as `next: "builder"` (approved). Write the remapped value to state for downstream consumers. If Reviewer A says `next: "planner"`, it means revision needed — no remapping.

### Hard Phase Gate (No Pre-Build Source Edits)

Before Step 4 (Build Phase), the orchestrator and all agents MUST NOT edit source/product files.

- In phases `plan`, `plan_reviewed`, `presenting`, and `presentation_complete`, writes are limited to quest artifacts under `.quest/**` only.
- Any implementation request received before Build must be captured as plan feedback (`.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/user_feedback.md`) and deferred to Step 4.
- If any pre-Build action would modify non-`.quest/**` files, STOP and ask the user whether to proceed to Build first.

### Context Retention Rule

After every subagent invocation (`Task`, `python3 scripts/quest_claude_runner.py`, or `mcp__codex__codex`), the orchestrator retains ONLY:
1. The **artifact path(s)** from the ARTIFACTS line of the handoff
2. The **one-line SUMMARY** from the SUMMARY line of the handoff
3. The **STATUS** and **NEXT** values for routing decisions

Everything else from the subagent response (plan text, review content, build output, fix details) is not carried forward in the orchestrator's working context. The orchestrator does not retain, summarize, or re-process subagent output beyond these handoff fields.

**Primary mechanism:** The orchestrator reads the agent's `handoff.json` file (see Handoff File Polling) to obtain status, artifacts, next, and summary. The full agent response body is discarded immediately. If `handoff.json` is unavailable or cannot be parsed as valid JSON, fall back to parsing the text `---HANDOFF---` block from the response.

**Bounded exceptions** (content is used immediately and not carried forward):
1. **Step 3.5 (Interactive Plan Presentation):** The orchestrator loads plan content for human interaction. This is bounded and deliberate.
2. **Q&A loop (`needs_human`):** The orchestrator extracts questions from the subagent response text (before `---HANDOFF---`) to present to the user. The question text is used for the human exchange and not retained after re-invocation.
3. **Artifact recovery:** If an expected artifact file (e.g., `plan.md`) is not written by a subagent, the orchestrator extracts it from the response and writes it to disk. The response content is discarded immediately after writing.

**Why this works:** Every subagent reads files itself. The orchestrator's job is routing and state management, not content relay.

### Handoff File Polling

After any subagent completes, the orchestrator reads the agent's `handoff.json` file for routing decisions instead of parsing the full response.

**Pattern:**
1. Wait for the subagent to complete (Task completion or MCP response)
2. Read the expected `handoff.json` file (tiny JSON, ~200 bytes)
3. Use its `status`, `next`, `summary`, and `artifacts` fields for routing and user display
4. Discard the full agent response -- do not retain, summarize, or process it
5. **Artifact preparation (before every role invocation):**
   Before invoking any role, the orchestrator MUST:
   1. Resolve artifact paths: `expected_artifacts_for_role(quest_dir, phase, agent)`
   2. Prepare files: `prepare_artifact_files(paths)` — creates parent directories and truncates every resolved role-output path. Canonical files that must survive failed attempts MUST NOT be returned by `expected_artifacts_for_role`; use scratch paths and publish after validation instead.
   3. Include in the role prompt:
      ```
      Artifact files have been prepared for you. Overwrite these files directly:
      - <path1>
      - <path2>
      Do not create Quest artifacts via shell redirection, heredocs, or echo.
      ```
   This applies to ALL orchestrators (Claude-led and Codex-led) and ALL runtimes (native Claude, bridge Claude, Codex). The preparation logic does not branch on orchestrator identity.

   **Codex sandbox permissions:** The orchestrator passes `sandbox_permissions: "workspace-write"` by default for Codex invocations. Tier B may escalate to `"danger-full-access"` ONLY when the user has explicitly approved that broader access or an equivalent persisted approval exists (see below). It is never automatic.

6. **Three-tier fallback ladder for missing/unparsable handoff.json:**

   Use `classify_failure_kind(result, artifact_paths, workspace_root)` to determine which tier applies. Classification order: timeout → invocation → write-boundary (out-of-workspace + missing artifacts) → permission → model.

   **Tier A — Normal run (already completed, failed):**
   The initial invocation with standard permissions and artifact preparation.

   **Tier B — Permission/transport retry (same runtime, same model):**
   Triggered ONLY when failure is classified as `write_boundary` or `permission`.
   - **Codex:** Retry with `sandbox_permissions: "danger-full-access"` only when the user has explicitly approved that broader access or an equivalent persisted approval exists. Otherwise stop and request that approval instead of silently changing the sandbox.
   - **Bridge-invoked Claude:** Add the out-of-workspace artifact directory to `--add-dir`.
   - **Native Claude `Task(...)`:** Widen tool permissions for the specific directory.
   - Prompt is unchanged (same task, same contract). Only the permission posture changes.
   - If Tier B also fails, proceed to Tier C.

   **Tier C — Cross-runtime fallback or block:**
   Triggered when:
   - Tier B was attempted and still failed, OR
   - Failure is NOT write-boundary/permission (timeout, model failure, invocation error)

   **Claude runtime invocation (Tier C):**
   - **Native Claude `Task(...)`:** If `handoff.json` is missing/unparsable, parse text `---HANDOFF---` as fallback.
   - **Bridge-invoked Claude (`python3 scripts/quest_claude_runner.py`):**
     - **Timeout:** Retry the same Claude role once with a reduced artifact-first prompt: no questions, no `needs_human`, read only the listed files, and write the required artifacts plus `handoff.json` before any optional commentary. If the second attempt also times out, treat the step as `blocked`.
     - **Auth/CLI/environment failure** (for example Claude CLI missing from `PATH`, not authenticated, or bridge script missing): Do NOT retry. Treat the step as `blocked` and surface the stderr summary to the user.
     - **Other failures** (missing/unparsable handoff, malformed output, `blocked`): Re-run the same Claude role once with a reduced artifact-first prompt and a strict reminder to write the expected artifact files and `handoff.json`. If the second attempt still fails, parse text `---HANDOFF---` as last-resort compatibility fallback; if no parseable text handoff exists, treat the step as `blocked`.

   **Codex invocation — Tier C (`mcp__codex__codex`):**
   - **Timeout (`McpError` / request timed out):** Do NOT retry. Fall back to the equivalent Claude `Task` immediately.
   - **Other failures** (missing/unparsable handoff, non-compliant output, `blocked`): Re-run the same Codex role once with a strict reminder. If the second attempt still fails, invoke the equivalent Claude `Task` fallback for that step.
   - Only after this fallback chain, if the final attempt still has no parseable `handoff.json`, parse text `---HANDOFF---` as last-resort compatibility fallback.

**Expected handoff.json locations:**

| Phase | Agent | handoff.json path |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| Plan | Planner | `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/handoff.json` |
| Plan Review | Slot A | `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/handoff_plan-reviewer-a.json` |
| Plan Review | Slot B | `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/handoff_plan-reviewer-b.json` |
| Plan Review | Arbiter | `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/handoff_arbiter.json` |
| Build | Builder | `.quest/<id>/phase_02_implementation/handoff.json` |
| Code Review | Slot A | `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/handoff_code-reviewer-a.json` |
| Code Review | Slot B | `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/handoff_code-reviewer-b.json` |
| Fix | Fixer | `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/handoff_fixer.json` |

The orchestrator NEVER reads full review files, plan content, or build output for routing decisions. Only handoff.json (and, for Step 3.5, the plan file itself as a bounded exception).

**Claude bridge response handling:** In Codex-led sessions, prefer `python3 scripts/quest_claude_runner.py` for Claude-designated roles. It polls the expected `handoff.json` file, defaults to `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, adds explicit repo/quest filesystem access via `--add-dir`, and logs `runtime=claude` to `context_health.log`. If the helper cannot be used, a raw `python3 scripts/quest_claude_bridge.py` call is still allowed, but the orchestrator must manually perform the same file polling, filesystem access, and logging steps.

**Codex MCP response handling:** After a `mcp__codex__codex` call returns, the orchestrator reads the corresponding `handoff.json` file and does NOT retain the Codex response body in working context. The response may still appear in the conversation history (platform limitation), but the orchestrator treats it as consumed and does not reference it for any subsequent decision.

**Codex non-interactive contract (all `mcp__codex__codex` calls):**
- Codex must not ask the user questions and must not return `STATUS: needs_human`.
- If context is incomplete, Codex makes explicit assumptions in the artifact and continues.
- If it cannot proceed safely, Codex returns `STATUS: blocked` with a concrete reason.
- Orchestrator handling for Codex failures follows the **three-tier fallback ladder** (see Handoff File Polling):
  - **Tier B** (write-boundary/permission): Same Codex runtime, `sandbox_permissions: "danger-full-access"` only with explicit user approval or an equivalent persisted approval.
  - **Tier C** (timeout, model, or Tier B exhausted):
    - **Timeout (`McpError`):** Skip retry. Fall back to the equivalent Claude `Task` role immediately.
    - **Other failures** (`needs_human`, non-compliant output, missing/unparsable handoff, `blocked`):
      1. Re-invoke the same Codex role once with a strict reminder: "no questions, no `needs_human`, make explicit assumptions."
      2. If the second attempt still fails, fall back to the equivalent Claude `Task` role for that step.
  - Only after the fallback chain may text `---HANDOFF---` parsing be used as a last-resort compatibility path.
  - Only enter human Q&A if the Claude runtime fallback returns `STATUS: needs_human`.

**MANDATORY — Context health logging:** Every single time you read a handoff.json file (or fall back to text parsing), you MUST append one line to `.quest/<id>/logs/context_health.log` BEFORE making any routing decision. This is not optional. Do this for every agent, every phase, no exceptions. Create the `.quest/<id>/logs/` directory first if it does not exist. `scripts/quest_claude_runner.py` already does this for bridge-invoked Claude roles.

**Format:**
```
<timestamp> | phase=<phase> | agent=<agent_name> | runtime=claude|codex | iter=<plan_iteration or fix_iteration> | handoff_json=found|missing|unparsable | source=handoff_json|text_fallback
```

Use `plan_iteration` for plan/plan_review phases, `fix_iteration` for code_review/fix phases, and `1` for build (single pass).
Set `runtime` to the runtime actually used for that invocation (`claude` or `codex`).
Never infer runtime from the agent label/name (for example `plan-reviewer-a`); labels are role identifiers, not backend evidence.

Runtime attribution rule (authoritative):
- Log `runtime=claude` only when the invocation actually used Claude `Task(...)` or `python3 scripts/quest_claude_runner.py`.
- Log `runtime=codex` when invocation used `mcp__codex__codex` or Codex agent tools (`spawn_agent`/`worker`/`explorer`).
- If a role expected to be Claude is executed with Codex fallback, keep the same role label but log `runtime=codex`.

**Example log for a quest with 2 plan iterations:**
```
2026-02-15T00:12:00Z | phase=plan | agent=planner | runtime=claude | iter=1 | handoff_json=found | source=handoff_json
2026-02-15T00:15:00Z | phase=plan_review | agent=plan-reviewer-a | runtime=claude | iter=1 | handoff_json=found | source=handoff_json
2026-02-15T00:15:00Z | phase=plan_review | agent=plan-reviewer-b | runtime=codex | iter=1 | handoff_json=missing | source=text_fallback
2026-02-15T00:18:00Z | phase=plan_review | agent=arbiter | runtime=claude | iter=1 | handoff_json=found | source=handoff_json
2026-02-15T00:25:00Z | phase=plan | agent=planner | runtime=claude | iter=2 | handoff_json=found | source=handoff_json
2026-02-15T00:28:00Z | phase=plan_review | agent=plan-reviewer-a | runtime=claude | iter=2 | handoff_json=found | source=handoff_json
2026-02-15T00:28:00Z | phase=plan_review | agent=plan-reviewer-b | runtime=codex | iter=2 | handoff_json=found | source=handoff_json
2026-02-15T00:31:00Z | phase=plan_review | agent=arbiter | runtime=claude | iter=2 | handoff_json=found | source=handoff_json
```

This log is how we measure whether the handoff.json pattern is working. It is displayed to the user at quest completion (Step 7). If you skip logging, the compliance report will be incomplete.

### Step 0: Resume Check

If the user provides a quest ID matching either supported Quest ID format (`<slug>_YYYY-MM-DD__HHMM` or `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM__<slug>`):

1. Check if `.quest/<id>/state.json` exists
2. If yes, read it and resume from the recorded phase
3. If the user also provided an instruction, route it (Step 2)
4. If no instruction, auto-resume based on state:
   - `phase: plan` + no approval verdict → continue plan phase
   - `phase: plan` + approved (arbiter verdict in workflow, or reviewer-a verdict with remapped `next: "builder"` in solo; accept legacy `next: "arbiter"` too) → proceed to Step 3.5 (Interactive Presentation)
   - `phase: plan_reviewed` → proceed to Step 3.5 (Interactive Presentation)
   - `phase: presenting` → proceed to Step 3.5 (Interactive Presentation)
   - `phase: presentation_complete` → proceed to Step 4 gate check (ask to proceed with build)
   - `phase: building` → check for builder output, route to review
   - `phase: reviewing` → check if fixes needed
   - `phase: complete` → show summary

### Step 1: Precondition Check

This workflow expects to be invoked with a quest brief already prepared.

1. Verify `.quest/<id>/quest_brief.md` exists
2. If it does not exist, STOP and report error: "Quest brief not found. The routing layer should have created it before invoking workflow."
3. Read `.quest/<id>/state.json` and determine the source workspace root for code-bearing phases:
   - If `worktree_path` exists and the directory is present, set `source_workspace_root = worktree_path`
   - Otherwise set `source_workspace_root = <repo root>`
   - All source edits plus any `git status`, `git diff`, and `git log` commands that are used in Steps 4-7 MUST run from `source_workspace_root`
   - If `vcs_available == false`, skip git commands entirely and use the documented no-VCS fallbacks instead
   - Quest artifacts always remain under `.quest/<id>/` in the original repo root; when `source_workspace_root != <repo root>`, prefer absolute quest artifact paths when invoking builder, reviewers, and fixer
4. Verify branch context:
   - If `branch` exists in state.json and `branch_mode == "branch"`, compare it to `git branch --show-current` in `source_workspace_root`
   - If `branch_mode == "worktree"`, verify the directory at `worktree_path` still exists
   - If `branch_mode == "worktree"` and `branch` exists in state.json, also compare it to `git branch --show-current` in `source_workspace_root`
   - If verification fails, STOP and ask the user to confirm before continuing — running in the wrong workspace defeats startup isolation
5. If the checks pass, proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Route Intent

Determine the action based on instruction + current state:

| Instruction contains | State | Action |
|---------------------|-------|--------|
| "plan", "design", or new quest | any | → Plan Phase |
| "implement", "build", "code" | plan approved | → Build Phase |
| "review" | has implementation | → Review Phase |
| "fix" | has review issues | → Fix Phase |
| no instruction | pending plan | → Plan Phase |
| no instruction | plan_reviewed | → Step 3.5 (Interactive Presentation) |
| no instruction | presenting | → Step 3.5 (Interactive Presentation) |
| no instruction | presentation_complete | → Step 4 (Build Phase) |
| no instruction | plan approved (arbiter verdict exists, phase is still `plan`) | → Step 3.5 (Interactive Presentation) |
| no instruction | built | → Review Phase |

### Step 3: Plan Phase

**Read allowlist gates:**
```
auto_approve_phases.plan_creation
auto_approve_phases.plan_review
auto_approve_phases.plan_refinement
gates.max_plan_iterations (default: 4)
```

**Loop:**

0. **Clear stale handoff and scratch files:** If `plan_iteration >= 1` (i.e., any refinement pass after the first), delete any existing `handoff*.json` files in `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/` to prevent stale data from a previous iteration being read. Also delete stale arbiter scratch files (`arbiter_verdict.md.next`, `review_findings.json.next`, `review_backlog.json.next`) before each arbiter attempt. Do **not** truncate last-known-good canonical files (`arbiter_verdict.md`, `review_findings.json`, `review_backlog.json`) during cleanup.

1. **Update state:** `plan_iteration += 1`, `status: in_progress`, `last_role: planner_agent`

1.5 **Planner startup deferred-backlog scan (exact path match):**
   - Candidate paths come from path-like tokens in `.quest/<id>/quest_brief.md`
   - Run:
     - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py scan-backlog --jsonl .quest/backlog/deferred_findings.jsonl --paths <candidate-paths...> --output .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/deferred_backlog_matches.json`
   - If the JSONL file is missing, treat it as empty backlog (no error).
   - If matches exist, surface: `N deferred findings touch this code -- pull into scope?`

2. **Invoke Planner** (default Codex `mcp__codex__codex`, Claude runtime fallback):
   - Read `models.planner` from allowlist.
   - If planner model is Codex, invoke via `mcp__codex__codex` with `sandbox_permissions: "workspace-write"`.
   - If planner model is Claude, invoke through Claude runtime (native `Task(...)` when available, bridge in Codex-led sessions).
   - **Artifact preparation** (per Handoff File Polling §5): Resolve and prepare `plan.md` and `handoff.json` in `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/`.
   - Prompt: Reference file paths only, do not embed artifact content:
     - Quest brief: `.quest/<id>/quest_brief.md`
     - Deferred backlog matches (if present): `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/deferred_backlog_matches.json`
     - Arbiter verdict (iteration 2+): `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/arbiter_verdict.md`
     - User feedback (if present): `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/user_feedback.md`
   - Require the prompt to include:
     - Artifact files have been prepared. Overwrite them directly:
       - `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/plan.md`
       - `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/handoff.json`
     - Do not create Quest artifacts via shell redirection, heredocs, or echo.
     - handoff.json schema: `{"status", "artifacts", "next", "summary"}`
     - End with: `---HANDOFF--- STATUS/ARTIFACTS/NEXT/SUMMARY`
     - `NEXT: plan_review`
   - Wait for the selected runtime to complete
   - Read `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/handoff.json` for status/routing
   - Verify `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/plan.md` exists (from handoff.artifacts)
   - Apply deterministic precedence from **Handoff File Polling** for native Claude task vs bridge execution
   - Fallback: if handoff.json missing or unparsable after that precedence, parse text handoff from response; if plan.md not written, extract from response and write it

3. **Read review config from allowlist:**
   - `review_mode` (default: `auto`)
   - `fast_review_thresholds` (not used for plan review)
   - For plan review: treat `auto` as `full`. Use `fast` only if explicitly set.

4. **Invoke Plan Reviewers:**

   **If `quest_mode == "solo"`:** Invoke ONLY Reviewer A. Skip Reviewer B entirely. Log: `Plan review: dispatched=single (solo mode)` to `.quest/<id>/logs/parallelism.log`.

   **If `quest_mode == "workflow"` (default):** Invoke BOTH Plan Reviewers IN PARALLEL.

   Read `models.plan-reviewer-a` and `models.plan-reviewer-b` from allowlist to determine runtime for each slot. If model is Claude, use Claude runtime; if Codex, use `mcp__codex__codex`.

   Two different models review independently for model diversity:
   - **Reviewer A**: dispatched by orchestrator → `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_plan-reviewer-a.md`
   - **Reviewer B** (workflow only): dispatched by orchestrator → `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_plan-reviewer-b.md`

   **Artifact preparation** (per Handoff File Polling §5): Before issuing reviewer calls, resolve and prepare artifacts for both Reviewer A (`review_plan-reviewer-a.md`, `handoff_plan-reviewer-a.json`) and Reviewer B (`review_plan-reviewer-b.md`, `handoff_plan-reviewer-b.json`) in `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/`.

   **Slot A** (runtime per `models.plan-reviewer-a`; full and fast modes):
   **Full mode** (default for plan review):
   ```

     subagent_type: "plan-reviewer",

   ```
   - **Before issuing the calls**, record the current wall-clock time as `dispatch_start`
   - Issue BOTH calls in the SAME message for parallel execution
   - Wait for BOTH to complete
   - Record the current wall-clock time as `dispatch_end`
   - Read `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/handoff_plan-reviewer-a.json` and `handoff_plan-reviewer-b.json`
   - Verify both review files exist (from handoff.artifacts)
   - Apply the **three-tier fallback ladder** from **Handoff File Polling** §6:
     - Claude slot follows the Claude-runtime precedence: native task may use direct text fallback; bridge path applies Tier B (permission escalation via `--add-dir`) for write-boundary/permission failures, then Tier C (retry once for timeout/malformed output, block immediately on auth/CLI failures).
     - Codex slot: classify failure via `classify_failure_kind` logic. Tier B (write-boundary/permission): retry with `sandbox_permissions: "danger-full-access"` only with explicit user approval or an equivalent persisted approval; otherwise stop and surface the approval need. Tier C (timeout, model, or Tier B exhausted): timeout → Claude runtime fallback immediately; other failures → retry once with strict non-interactive reminder, then Claude runtime fallback.

   **Parallelism check (orchestrator-timed):**
   1. Create `.quest/<id>/logs/` directory if it doesn't exist
   2. Append a line to `.quest/<id>/logs/parallelism.log`:
      ```
      Plan review: dispatched=concurrent (wall: <dispatch_start>-<dispatch_end>)
      ```
      The wall-clock duration covers both agents. Since both calls are issued in the same message, they run concurrently by construction. Agent self-reported timestamps are unreliable and must NOT be used for parallelism verification.

5. **Invoke Arbiter or use Solo verdict:**

   **If `quest_mode == "solo"`:** Skip Arbiter entirely. Use Reviewer A's verdict directly with remapping:
   - Read `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/handoff_plan-reviewer-a.json`
   - If `next: "arbiter"` → remap to `next: "builder"` (approved in solo mode)
   - If `next: "planner"` → plan needs revision (no remapping)
   - Do not require `review_backlog.json` for the solo transition path.
   - Log: `Plan review: arbiter=skipped (solo mode, using reviewer-a verdict)` to `.quest/<id>/logs/parallelism.log`

   **If `quest_mode == "workflow"` (default):** Read `models.arbiter` from allowlist. Invoke Arbiter through the corresponding runtime:
   - Contract-hardening rollout order (required when implementing this behavior): land workflow + helper CLI (`build-backlog --phase`) + runtime `.next` artifact wiring first; trim arbiter output contract second. This prevents transient mismatches during migration.
   - Before each arbiter attempt, remove stale scratch artifacts:
     - `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_findings.json.next`
     - `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_backlog.json.next`
   - **Artifact preparation** (per Handoff File Polling §5): Resolve and prepare:
     - `arbiter_verdict.md.next`
     - `review_findings.json.next`
     - `handoff_arbiter.json`
     in `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/`.
     Canonical `arbiter_verdict.md` is not prepared or truncated; publish `arbiter_verdict.md.next` only after validation succeeds.
   - Use a short prompt with path references only:
     ```
     You are the Arbiter Agent.

     Read your instructions: .skills/quest/agents/arbiter.md

     Quest brief: .quest/<id>/quest_brief.md
     Plan: .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/plan.md
     Review A: .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_plan-reviewer-a.md
     Review B: .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_plan-reviewer-b.md

     Artifact files have been prepared for you. Overwrite these files directly:
     - .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/arbiter_verdict.md.next
     - .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_findings.json.next
     - .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/handoff_arbiter.json
     Do not create Quest artifacts via shell redirection, heredocs, or echo.
     End with: ---HANDOFF--- STATUS/ARTIFACTS/NEXT/SUMMARY
     NEXT: builder (approve) or planner (iterate)
     ```
   - Wait for the selected runtime to complete
   - Read `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/handoff_arbiter.json`
   - Apply deterministic precedence from **Handoff File Polling** for native Claude task vs bridge execution
   - Fallback: if handoff.json missing or unparsable after that precedence, parse text handoff from response
   - Immediately validate findings:
     - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py validate-findings --input .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_findings.json.next`
   - If findings validation fails:
     - Retry arbiter exactly once with the validator stderr/stdout embedded in the retry prompt.
     - Re-run `validate-findings` on the second attempt.
     - If validation still fails, STOP route:
       - Do **not** call `quest_state.py --transition plan_reviewed`.
       - Surface validator output in orchestrator logs/user message.
       - Keep canonical artifacts untouched; keep `.next` files for debugging.
   - If arbiter handoff says `next: planner`:
     - Skip `build-backlog` and skip review findings/backlog publish.
     - Publish the validated verdict scratch artifact:
       - `os.replace(".quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/arbiter_verdict.md.next", ".quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/arbiter_verdict.md")`
     - Clean `review_findings.json.next` / `review_backlog.json.next` scratch files.
     - Preserve canonical `review_findings.json` / `review_backlog.json`.
     - Return control to planner refinement loop.
   - If arbiter handoff says `next: builder` and findings validation passed:
     - Build backlog from validated findings:
       - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py build-backlog --phase plan --findings .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_findings.json.next --output .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_backlog.json.next`
     - Validate the plan-phase backlog before publish:
       - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py validate-backlog --input .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_backlog.json.next --expected-phase plan --strict-plan-defaults`
     - On build-backlog or validate-backlog failure: STOP route, do not transition, preserve canonical artifacts, leave `.next` files for inspection.
     - Publish atomically only after validation succeeds:
       - `os.replace(".quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/arbiter_verdict.md.next", ".quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/arbiter_verdict.md")`
       - `os.replace(".quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_findings.json.next", ".quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_findings.json")`
       - `os.replace(".quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_backlog.json.next", ".quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_backlog.json")`
     - On publish failure: STOP route, log full error, do not transition, and leave `.next` files in place.

6. **Check verdict and transition guard:**
   - If `NEXT: builder`:
     - **Workflow mode only:** Transition only after successful `validate-findings` + `build-backlog --phase plan` + `validate-backlog --expected-phase plan --strict-plan-defaults` + atomic publish. In solo mode the arbiter is skipped (see item 5 above), and so is the validate/build/publish pipeline — transition directly without those prerequisites.
     - Then transition state atomically: `python3 scripts/quest_state.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --transition plan_reviewed --status complete --last-verdict approve --expect-phase plan` — if this fails, report the validation error to the user and STOP. Do NOT modify state.json manually. Then proceed to **Step 3.5** (Interactive Presentation). Do not attempt the `presenting` transition while state still says `phase: plan`.
   - If `NEXT: planner` → Check iteration count
     - If `plan_iteration >= max_plan_iterations`: Warn user, ask to proceed anyway or review manually
     - If `auto_approve_phases.plan_refinement` is false: Ask user to approve refinement
     - Otherwise: Loop back to step 0 (stale handoff/scratch cleanup)

- **UI work:** see [UI Work Propagation](#ui-work-propagation-cross-cutting--applies-to-every-phase) at the top of this file — the rule is uniform across phases.

### Step 3.5: Interactive Plan Presentation (MANDATORY HUMAN GATE)

After plan approval, present the plan interactively before proceeding to build.

**THIS IS A MANDATORY STOP POINT.** You MUST present the plan to the human user, ask for their approval, and STOP execution until the human responds. Do not assume approval. Do not skip this step. Do not auto-approve. Do not proceed to Step 4 until the human has explicitly approved.

**On entry:** Transition state atomically: `python3 scripts/quest_state.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --transition presenting --status in_progress --expect-phase plan_reviewed` — if this fails, report the validation error to the user and STOP. Do NOT modify state.json manually.

**1. Show Executive Summary:**
   Extract a five-section executive summary from `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/plan.md`. Each section has a precedence chain — pull the first match. Omit any section whose source isn't present. Do NOT fabricate content for a missing section.

   a. **Problem (1–2 lines)** — pull from `## Overview` → `## Problem` → first non-heading paragraph of the plan (skip YAML frontmatter, skip lines starting with `#`).
   b. **Approach (2–4 lines)** — pull from `## Approach` → `## Strategy` → `## Solution` → first paragraph of `## Implementation`.
   c. **Scope (3–6 bullets)** — extract from `## Files`, the phase headers (`### Phase N:` / `## Phase N:` / `**Phase N:**`), or numbered change sections (`### Change N:` / `#### Change N:`). One bullet per file or phase title.
   d. **Acceptance Criteria (top 3)** — first three items from `## Acceptance Criteria`. If more exist, append `+N more — see plan` as a fourth bullet.
   e. **Risks / Open Questions (0–3 bullets)** — pull from `## Risks` → `## Open Questions` → `## Tradeoffs`. If no such section exists in the plan, omit this entire heading and append the line `Plan does not document risks — consider sharpening.` immediately after the Acceptance Criteria block.

   Render as:
   ```
   ═══ Plan Summary: <quest title or slug> ═══

   Problem
     <text>

   Approach
     <text>

   Scope
     • <bullet>
     • ...

   Acceptance Criteria (top 3)
     • <ac>
     • ...

   Risks / Open Questions
     • <bullet>
     • ...

   Full plan: .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/plan.md
   Verdict: <workflow mode: NEXT line from arbiter handoff; solo mode: Reviewer A next after solo remapping>
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════
   ```
   Target ~150–300 words across the five sections combined. Always print the header bar and the artifact path footer. In workflow mode, print the arbiter NEXT line. In solo mode, print Reviewer A's next value after solo remapping. Always print the closing bar last.

**2. Offer the Plan Presentation Menu:**
   After the executive summary, ask exactly. Option 2's wording depends on whether the plan actually contains a `## UX Defaults` section (not just the brief's `ui_work` flag — render-layer guards may have suppressed emission on a false-positive). If the plan has the section, use the UX-aware wording; otherwise the generic wording.
   ```
   How would you like to proceed?
     1. Walk me through it phase by phase
     2. Sharpen the plan with me — I'll challenge assumptions and tradeoffs (Q&A, ~5–10 questions)
   ```
   When the plan contains a `## UX Defaults` section, substitute option 2 wording with:
   ```
     2. Sharpen UX defaults (mobile, gray ramp, density, ratio, accent, destructive actions) and the plan with me
   ```
   Then add option 3:
   ```
     3. Looks good, proceed to build
   ```
   STOP and wait for the human to respond. Do not assume a default.

**3. Handle Menu Response:**
   - **Option 1 (walkthrough)** — also matches `walk`, `walkthrough`, `phases`, `detail`, `detailed`, `yes`: Continue to substep 4 (Phase Extraction). After the walkthrough completes (substep 7's last-phase branch), return here and re-show the menu **with option 1 removed** (only options 2 and 3 remain). Repeat handling.
   - **Option 2 (sharpen)** — also matches `sharpen`, `grill`, `stress`, `challenge`: Invoke the `/sharpen` skill (`.skills/sharpen/SKILL.md`). **When the plan contains a `## UX Defaults` section, pass `ux-defaults` as the argument so sharpen runs its six-question UX interview against the plan; otherwise invoke sharpen against `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/plan.md` for a generic sharpen pass.** When sharpen completes, read its structured exit summary (Resolved / Open / Next):
     - If the **Next** field says `no changes needed` (or equivalent — no revisions listed): Transition state atomically `python3 scripts/quest_state.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --transition presentation_complete --status complete --expect-phase presenting` — if this fails, report the validation error to the user and STOP. Do NOT modify state.json manually. Then proceed to Step 4. **Sharpen completion is terminal — do not re-show the menu.**
     - If the **Next** field lists revisions (e.g. `re-plan with these revisions: …`): Jump to substep 8 (Change Handling) using the **sharpen entry path**. Substep 8(a) is skipped; substep 8(b) writes the sharpen-format block to user_feedback.md.
   - **Option 3 (proceed)** — also matches `proceed`, `build`, `looks good`, `ship it`, `no`, `n`, `skip`: Transition state atomically `python3 scripts/quest_state.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --transition presentation_complete --status complete --expect-phase presenting` — if this fails, report the validation error to the user and STOP. Do NOT modify state.json manually. Then proceed to Step 4 (Build Phase).
   - **Unrecognized response:** Re-ask the menu once. If still unrecognized, treat as Option 3.

**4. Extract Phases from Plan:**
   Parse plan.md to identify phases using these patterns (in order of precedence):

   a. **Explicit phase headers** - Look for:
      - `### Phase 1:` or `### Phase 1 -` (h3 with "Phase N")
      - `## Phase 1:` or `## Phase 1 -` (h2 with "Phase N")
      - `**Phase 1:**` or `**Phase 1 -**` (bold with "Phase N")

   b. **Phases section with list** - Look for:
      - `## Phases` header followed by numbered or bulleted list items
      - Each list item becomes a phase

   c. **Numbered change sections** - Look for:
      - `#### Change 1:` or `### Change 1:`
      - Treat each change as a phase

   d. **Fallback (single-phase)** - If none of the above patterns found:
      - Treat entire Implementation section as a single phase
      - Display with title "Implementation Overview"

**5. Extract Per-Phase Acceptance Criteria:**
   For each identified phase, extract acceptance criteria using these patterns:

   a. **Per-phase AC subheading** - Look within each phase section for:
      - `**Acceptance Criteria:**` or `#### Acceptance Criteria`
      - Extract the list items following this heading

   b. **AC references** - Look for parenthetical references like:
      - `(AC1)`, `(AC2)`, `(Covers AC 3)`, `(Addresses acceptance criterion 1)`
      - Map these to the global Acceptance Criteria section and display those specific items

   c. **Fallback (global ACs)** - If phase has no explicit ACs:
      - Display global acceptance criteria from the plan's main `## Acceptance Criteria` section
      - Prefix with: "This phase contributes to the following acceptance criteria:"

**6. Present Each Phase:**
   For each phase:
   a. Display phase title (e.g., "Phase 1: Add Presentation Logic")
   b. Display phase description/goal (first paragraph of phase section)
   c. Display key implementation details:
      - Files to change (look for file paths or "Files:" subsection)
      - Functions to add/modify (look for function names or "Key Functions:" subsection)
   d. Display acceptance criteria for this phase (from substep 5)
   e. Ask: "Questions about this phase? Or changes you'd like to request? (continue/question/change)"

**7. Handle Phase Response:**
   - If "continue" (or "c", "next", "ok", "looks good", etc.) -> Move to next phase, or if last phase: walkthrough is complete — return to substep 2 (the menu) **with option 1 (walkthrough) removed** (only options 2 and 3 remain). Re-render the executive summary header is NOT required; jump straight to the reduced menu.
   - If "question" (or "q", "?", user asks a question directly) -> Answer the question using plan context, then re-ask: "Any other questions, or ready to continue? (continue/question/change)"
   - If "change" (or "modify", "revise", "update", user requests a change directly) -> Proceed to substep 8 (Change Handling) via the walkthrough entry path.

**8. Change Handling:**
   This substep has two entry paths:
   - **Walkthrough entry** (from substep 7's "change" branch): the user describes changes interactively.
   - **Sharpen entry** (from substep 3's option 2 when sharpen surfaced revisions): the structured sharpen output is the change request.

   Steps:
   a. (Walkthrough entry only) Prompt the user: "Please describe the changes you'd like:" and record their response verbatim.
   b. Append to `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/user_feedback.md`:
      - **Walkthrough format:**
        ```
        ## Change Request (Iteration <plan_iteration + 1>)
        Date: <timestamp>
        Phase: <current phase number or "General">
        Request: <user's change request verbatim>
        ```
      - **Sharpen format:**
        ```
        ## Sharpen Outcome (Iteration <plan_iteration + 1>)
        Date: <timestamp>

        Resolved:
        <sharpen "Resolved" block verbatim>

        Open:
        <sharpen "Open" block verbatim>

        Next:
        <sharpen "Next" block verbatim>
        ```
   c. **Update state:** `phase: plan`, `status: in_progress`
   d. Display: "Re-running plan with your feedback..."
   e. Return to Step 3, item 1:
      - Planner will be invoked with user_feedback.md referenced (per Step 3, item 2 — Planner invocation above)
      - plan_iteration increments as normal
      - Full review cycle (Claude slot A + Codex slot B + Arbiter) runs
      - After approval, Step 3.5 presentation starts fresh from substep 1

### Step 4: Build Phase

**MANDATORY GATE CHECK — Do not skip this:**
- Read `auto_approve_phases.implementation` from allowlist
- If false (default): You MUST ask the user "Plan approved. Proceed with implementation?" and then STOP and wait for the human to respond. Do not proceed until the human explicitly says yes. Do not assume approval. Do not auto-approve.
- If true: You may proceed without asking
- **If you have not received explicit human approval from Step 3.5 or this gate, STOP NOW and ask.**

**Build:**

1. **Atomic transition:** `python3 scripts/quest_state.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --transition building --status in_progress --last-role builder_agent --expect-phase presentation_complete` — if this fails, report the validation error to the user and STOP. Do NOT modify state.json manually.

2. **Invoke Builder** (default Codex `mcp__codex__codex`, Claude runtime fallback):
   - Read `models.builder` from allowlist.
   - If builder model is Codex, invoke via `mcp__codex__codex` with `sandbox_permissions: "workspace-write"`.
   - If builder model is Claude, invoke through Claude runtime (native `Task(...)` when available, bridge in Codex-led sessions).
   - Run the builder from `source_workspace_root`. If this quest uses a separate worktree, source changes happen there while `.quest/<id>/...` artifacts still point at the original repo root.
   - **Artifact preparation** (per Handoff File Polling §5): Resolve and prepare `pr_description.md`, `builder_feedback_discussion.md`, and `handoff.json` in `.quest/<id>/phase_02_implementation/`.
   - Prompt: Reference file paths only, do not embed content:
     - Approved plan: `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/plan.md`
     - Quest brief: `.quest/<id>/quest_brief.md`
   - Require the prompt to include:
     - If using Codex path: `Read your instructions: .skills/quest/agents/builder.md`
     - Artifact files have been prepared. Overwrite them directly:
       - `.quest/<id>/phase_02_implementation/pr_description.md`
       - `.quest/<id>/phase_02_implementation/builder_feedback_discussion.md`
       - `.quest/<id>/phase_02_implementation/handoff.json`
     - Do not create Quest artifacts via shell redirection, heredocs, or echo.
     - handoff.json schema: `{"status", "artifacts", "next", "summary"}`
     - End with: `---HANDOFF--- STATUS/ARTIFACTS/NEXT/SUMMARY`
     - `NEXT: code_review`
   - Wait for selected tool call to complete
   - Read `.quest/<id>/phase_02_implementation/handoff.json` for status/routing
   - Verify artifacts written (from handoff.artifacts)
   - Apply the **three-tier fallback ladder** from **Handoff File Polling** §6:
     - Classify failure via `classify_failure_kind` logic.
     - **Tier B** (write-boundary/permission): Codex → retry with `sandbox_permissions: "danger-full-access"` only with explicit user approval or an equivalent persisted approval. Bridge Claude → add out-of-workspace dirs via `--add-dir`. Native Claude → widen tool permissions.
     - **Tier C** (timeout, model, invocation, or Tier B exhausted):
       - **Timeout (`McpError`):** Skip retry. Invoke Claude runtime fallback for builder immediately.
       - **Other failures** (`needs_human`, malformed output, missing/unparsable handoff, `blocked`):
         1. Re-run same runtime once with strict non-interactive reminder ("no questions, no `needs_human`, explicit assumptions").
         2. If still non-compliant, invoke Claude runtime fallback for builder with the same artifact-path contract.
     - If the Claude runtime fallback uses the bridge, apply bridge failure handling from **Handoff File Polling**.
     - Only ask the user questions if the Claude runtime fallback returns `needs_human`.
   - If the final selected attempt still has missing/unparsable handoff.json, parse text handoff from response as last-resort compatibility fallback.

3. **Atomic transition:** `python3 scripts/quest_state.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --transition reviewing --status in_progress --expect-phase building` — if this fails, report the validation error to the user and STOP. Do NOT modify state.json manually.

4. Proceed to Step 5

- **UI work:** see [UI Work Propagation](#ui-work-propagation-cross-cutting--applies-to-every-phase) at the top of this file — the rule is uniform across phases.

### Step 5: Review Phase

1. **Update state:** `status: in_progress`, `last_role: code_review_agent`

2. **Read review config from allowlist:**
   - `review_mode` (default: `auto`)
   - `fast_review_thresholds.max_files` (default: 5)
   - `fast_review_thresholds.max_loc` (default: 300)
   - Read `vcs_available` from `.quest/<id>/state.json` (default: `true` if missing)


3. **Build a change summary for Codex:**
   - If `vcs_available == true`, compute from git in `source_workspace_root` (the canonical source for what changed):
     - File list: `git diff --name-only`
     - Diff stats: `git diff --stat`
     - LOC totals: `git diff --numstat` and sum added + deleted.
   - If `vcs_available == false`, do not run git diff commands. Instead:
     - File list: `Changed file list unavailable (no VCS)`
     - Diff stats: `Diff stats unavailable (no VCS)`
     - LOC totals: unavailable
     - Effective review mode: **full**
     - Reviewer scope: inspect the implementation directly, using `.quest/<id>/phase_02_implementation/builder_feedback_discussion.md`, `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_fix_feedback_discussion.md` if present, the plan, and the source files themselves to determine touched areas.
   - Use the LOC totals and file count for `review_mode: auto` only when `vcs_available == true`:
     - If file_count ≤ max_files AND loc_total ≤ max_loc → **fast**
     - Otherwise → **full**

4. **Invoke Code Reviewers:**

   **If `quest_mode == "solo"`:** Invoke ONLY Reviewer A. Skip Reviewer B entirely. Log: `Code review: dispatched=single (solo mode)` to `.quest/<id>/logs/parallelism.log`.

   **If `quest_mode == "workflow"` (default):** Invoke BOTH Code Reviewers IN PARALLEL.

   Read `models.code-reviewer-a` and `models.code-reviewer-b` from allowlist to determine runtime for each slot. If model is Claude, use Claude runtime; if Codex, use `mcp__codex__codex`.

   Two different models review independently for model diversity:
   - **Reviewer A**: dispatched by orchestrator → `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_code-reviewer-a.md`
   - **Reviewer B** (workflow only): dispatched by orchestrator → `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_code-reviewer-b.md`

   **Artifact preparation** (per Handoff File Polling §5): Resolve and prepare:
   - Reviewer A: `review_code-reviewer-a.md`, `review_findings_code-reviewer-a.json`, `handoff_code-reviewer-a.json`
   - Reviewer B: `review_code-reviewer-b.md`, `review_findings_code-reviewer-b.json`, `handoff_code-reviewer-b.json`
   in `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/` (Reviewer B only in workflow mode).

   **Slot A** (runtime per `models.code-reviewer-a`; full and fast modes):
   **Full mode**:
   ```

   ```
   - **Note:** The `<file list>` and `<git diff --stat>` values embedded in these prompts are intentional small metadata (summary statistics and file names, typically a few lines). When `vcs_available == false`, these fields intentionally carry the explicit `no VCS` markers above. This is operational data for scoping the review, not subagent artifact content, and does not conflict with the Context Retention Rule.
   - **Before issuing the calls**, record the current wall-clock time as `dispatch_start`
   - Issue BOTH calls in the SAME message for parallel execution
   - Wait for BOTH to complete
   - Record the current wall-clock time as `dispatch_end`
   - Read `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/handoff_code-reviewer-a.json` and `handoff_code-reviewer-b.json`
   - Verify both review files exist (from handoff.artifacts)
   - Apply the **three-tier fallback ladder** from **Handoff File Polling** §6:
     - Claude slot follows the Claude-runtime precedence: native task may use direct text fallback; bridge path applies Tier B (permission escalation via `--add-dir`) for write-boundary/permission failures, then Tier C (retry once for timeout/malformed output, block immediately on auth/CLI failures).
     - Codex slot: classify failure via `classify_failure_kind` logic. Tier B (write-boundary/permission): retry with `sandbox_permissions: "danger-full-access"` only with explicit user approval or an equivalent persisted approval; otherwise stop and surface the approval need. Tier C (timeout, model, or Tier B exhausted): timeout → Claude runtime fallback immediately; other failures → retry once with strict non-interactive reminder, then Claude runtime fallback.

   **Parallelism check (orchestrator-timed):**
   1. Create `.quest/<id>/logs/` directory if it doesn't exist
   2. Append a line to `.quest/<id>/logs/parallelism.log`:
      ```
      Code review: dispatched=concurrent (wall: <dispatch_start>-<dispatch_end>)
      ```
      The wall-clock duration covers both agents. Since both calls are issued in the same message, they run concurrently by construction. Agent self-reported timestamps are unreliable and must NOT be used for parallelism verification.

5. **Merge canonical findings and build decisions backlog:**
   - Merge per-slot canonical findings into phase-level findings:
     - Workflow mode:
       - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py merge-findings --inputs .quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_findings_code-reviewer-a.json .quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_findings_code-reviewer-b.json --output .quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_findings.json`
     - Solo mode:
       - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py merge-findings --inputs .quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_findings_code-reviewer-a.json --output .quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_findings.json`
   - Validate merged findings:
     - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py validate-findings --input .quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_findings.json`
   - Build canonical review backlog (decision stage):
     - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py build-backlog --findings .quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_findings.json --output .quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_backlog.json`
   - Fixer intake is restricted to backlog entries with decision:
     - `fix_now`
     - `verify_first`
   - Deferred backlog handling:
     - For entries with decision `defer`, append to `.quest/backlog/deferred_findings.jsonl` with lineage fields using `append-deferred`

6. **Route after decisions stage:**
   - **Safety check:** If any reviewer handoff has `next: "fixer"` but the canonical backlog has no `fix_now`/`verify_first` items, warn the user: "Reviewer flagged issues but canonical backlog is empty — review findings may be incomplete." Ask the user how to proceed (re-review or manually inspect and repair the findings/handoffs). Do not auto-transition to fixing with an empty actionable backlog, and do not offer `accept as-is` unless an explicit waiver path is added to the validator contract.
   - If `review_backlog.json` contains any `fix_now` or `verify_first` item:
     - Transition atomically: `python3 scripts/quest_state.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --transition fixing --status in_progress --expect-phase reviewing`
     - Proceed to Step 6
   - If `review_backlog.json` contains any `needs_human_decision` item (even with no `fix_now`/`verify_first`):
     - Present `needs_human_decision` items to the user and ask how to proceed (fix now, defer with rationale, or explicitly reclassify the items so the backlog no longer requires human decision)
     - Do not auto-complete while `needs_human_decision` items exist
   - If no actionable items and no `needs_human_decision` items remain:
     - Transition atomically: `python3 scripts/quest_state.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --transition complete --status complete --expect-phase reviewing`
     - Proceed to Step 7

- **UI work:** see [UI Work Propagation](#ui-work-propagation-cross-cutting--applies-to-every-phase) at the top of this file — the rule is uniform across phases.

### Step 6: Fix Phase

**Read allowlist:** `gates.max_fix_iterations` (default: 3)

**Solo override:** `solo.max_fix_iterations` (default: 2)

**Solo mode cap:** If `quest_mode == "solo"`, cap `max_fix_iterations` at `min(solo.max_fix_iterations, gates.max_fix_iterations)`.

**Gate check:**
- Read `auto_approve_phases.fix_loop` from allowlist
- If false: Ask user "Code review found issues. Proceed with fixes?"

**Loop:**

1. **Update state:** `phase: fixing`, `fix_iteration += 1`, `last_role: fixer_agent`

2. **Invoke Fixer** (default Codex `mcp__codex__codex`, Claude runtime fallback):
   - Read `models.fixer` from allowlist.
   - If fixer model is Codex, invoke via `mcp__codex__codex` with `sandbox_permissions: "workspace-write"`.
   - If fixer model is Claude, invoke through Claude runtime (native `Task(...)` when available, bridge in Codex-led sessions).
   - Run the fixer from `source_workspace_root`. If this quest uses a separate worktree, source fixes happen there while `.quest/<id>/...` artifacts remain in the original repo root.
   - Prompt: Reference file paths only, do not embed content:
     - Code review A: `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_code-reviewer-a.md`
     - Code review B: `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_code-reviewer-b.md`
     - Decisions backlog: `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_backlog.json`
     - Changed files: <prepared review scope summary>
     - Quest brief: `.quest/<id>/quest_brief.md`
     - Plan: `.quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/plan.md`
     - Builder notes: `.quest/<id>/phase_02_implementation/builder_feedback_discussion.md`
   - **Artifact preparation** (per Handoff File Polling §5): Resolve and prepare `review_fix_feedback_discussion.md` and `handoff_fixer.json` in `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/`.
   - Require the prompt to include:
     - If using Codex path: `Read your instructions: .skills/quest/agents/fixer.md`
     - Write ONLY to these artifact files (source code changes go through normal edits):
       - `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/review_fix_feedback_discussion.md`
       - `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/handoff_fixer.json`
     - Implement only backlog entries with decisions `fix_now` and `verify_first`
     - Do not create Quest artifacts via shell redirection, heredocs, or echo.
     - handoff.json schema: `{"status", "artifacts", "next", "summary"}`
     - End with: `---HANDOFF--- STATUS/ARTIFACTS/NEXT/SUMMARY`
     - `NEXT: code_review`
   - Wait for selected tool call to complete
   - Read `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/handoff_fixer.json` for status/routing
   - Apply the **three-tier fallback ladder** from **Handoff File Polling** §6:
     - Classify failure via `classify_failure_kind` logic.
     - **Tier B** (write-boundary/permission): Codex → retry with `sandbox_permissions: "danger-full-access"` only with explicit user approval or an equivalent persisted approval. Bridge Claude → add out-of-workspace dirs via `--add-dir`. Native Claude → widen tool permissions.
     - **Tier C** (timeout, model, invocation, or Tier B exhausted):
       - **Timeout (`McpError`):** Skip retry. Invoke Claude runtime fallback for fixer immediately.
       - **Other failures** (`needs_human`, malformed output, missing/unparsable handoff, `blocked`):
         1. Re-run same runtime once with strict non-interactive reminder ("no questions, no `needs_human`, explicit assumptions").
         2. If still non-compliant, invoke Claude runtime fallback for fixer with the same artifact-path contract.
     - If the Claude runtime fallback uses the bridge, apply bridge failure handling from **Handoff File Polling**.
     - Only ask the user questions if the Claude runtime fallback returns `needs_human`.
   - If the final selected attempt still has missing/unparsable handoff.json, parse text handoff from response as last-resort compatibility fallback.

3. **Clear stale handoff files:** Delete any existing `handoff_code-reviewer-a.json` (and `handoff_code-reviewer-b.json` if workflow mode) in `.quest/<id>/phase_03_review/` to prevent stale data from the previous review iteration being read when code reviewers are re-invoked.

4. **Atomic transition:** `python3 scripts/quest_state.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --transition reviewing --status in_progress --expect-phase fixing` — if fails, report to user and STOP. Do NOT modify state.json manually.

5. **Re-invoke Code Reviewers** (same dispatch rules as Step 5 — solo dispatches only Reviewer A, workflow dispatches both)

6. **Rebuild decisions backlog and enforce loop bounds:**
   - Re-run Step 5 decisions stage (merge findings -> validate -> build `review_backlog.json` + alias).
   - If backlog has no `fix_now`/`verify_first` items:
     - Transition atomically: `python3 scripts/quest_state.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --transition complete --status complete --expect-phase reviewing`
     - Proceed to Step 7
   - If actionable items remain:
     - If `fix_iteration < max_fix_iterations`: loop back to step 1
     - If `fix_iteration >= max_fix_iterations`:
       - Rebuild backlog using at-cap policy (`--at-loop-cap`)
       - Convert remaining findings to `defer` (accepted debt rationale) or `needs_human_decision`
       - Append `defer` entries to `.quest/backlog/deferred_findings.jsonl`
       - Warn user, ask to proceed manually or accept remaining items as deferred debt

- **UI work:** see [UI Work Propagation](#ui-work-propagation-cross-cutting--applies-to-every-phase) at the top of this file — the rule is uniform across phases.

### Step 7: Complete

1. **Update state:** `phase: complete`, `status: complete`

2. **Ask user before celebrating:**
   - Prompt: "Quest is complete! What would you like to do?"
     - **Celebrate!** — proceed to step 3 (run the celebration animation)
     - **Skip celebration** — go straight to step 4 (journal + summary, no animation)
   - In non-interactive / CI environments, skip the prompt and run the celebration automatically

3. **Run celebration (skill-first):**
   - Invoke the `celebrate` skill and provide the quest ID/path so it reads artifacts and renders rich markdown directly
   - Do NOT call the Python celebration script from this step in interactive agent flows
   - Optional fallback (non-interactive/runtime-only): `python3 scripts/quest_celebrate/celebrate.py --quest-dir .quest/<id> --style epic || true`
   - This step is fire-and-forget: if celebration fails, quest completion continues

4. **Show summary** (before archiving — quest directory still exists):
    - Quest ID
    - Files changed
      - If `vcs_available == true`: from `git diff --name-only` in `source_workspace_root` and `state.json` artifact paths
      - If `vcs_available == false`: report `Changed source file list unavailable (no VCS)` and still list quest artifact paths from the handoff files/state
    - Total iterations (plan + fix, from `state.json`)
    - Parallel execution stats (read from `.quest/<id>/logs/parallelism.log` if it exists — show each line)
    - Location of artifacts (will be archived to `.quest/archive/<id>/`)
    - Location of journal entry (will be created next)
    - If `branch_mode == "worktree"` and `worktree_path` exists, remind the user that the implementation branch lives in that worktree and cleanup is manual via `git worktree remove <worktree_path>`

6. **Context health report:**
   If `.quest/<id>/logs/context_health.log` exists, display it in full:

   ```
   Context Health (handoff.json compliance):
   ---
   <contents of context_health.log, one line per agent>
   ---
   ```

   Then display a brief reflection, split by runtime and role:
   - Count entries with `source=handoff_json` vs `source=text_fallback`
   - Split by runtime using the `runtime=claude|codex` field from each log line
   - Runtime counts must come from logged runtime values only; do not infer runtime from role names.
   - Also split by role instance using `(phase, agent)` pairs (do NOT key by `agent` alone):
     - Planner = `(phase=plan, agent=planner)`
     - Plan Review Slot A = `(phase=plan_review, agent=plan-reviewer-a)`
     - Plan Review Slot B = `(phase=plan_review, agent=plan-reviewer-b)`
     - Arbiter = `(phase=plan_review, agent=arbiter)`
     - Builder = `(phase=build, agent=builder)`
     - Code Review Slot A = `(phase=code_review, agent=code-reviewer-a)`
     - Code Review Slot B = `(phase=code_review, agent=code-reviewer-b)`
     - Fixer = `(phase=fix, agent=fixer)`
   - For each role instance, report `X/Y` where:
     - `Y` = total observed invocations for that exact `(phase, agent)` pair in the log
     - `X` = observed invocations for that exact `(phase, agent)` pair with `source=handoff_json`
   - If a role/runtime did not run in this quest, display `0/0 (n/a)` instead of implying failure
   - Display:
     ```
     Handoff.json compliance:
       Claude agents: <N>/<total> (<percentage>%)
       Codex agents:  <N>/<total> (<percentage>%)
       Overall:       <N>/<total> (<percentage>%)

     Role-level compliance:
       Planner (<runtime>): <X>/<Y> (<percentage or n/a>)
       Plan Review Slot A (<runtime>): <X>/<Y> (<percentage or n/a>)
       Plan Review Slot B (<runtime>): <X>/<Y> (<percentage or n/a>)
       Arbiter (<runtime>): <X>/<Y> (<percentage or n/a>)
       Builder (<runtime>): <X>/<Y> (<percentage or n/a>)
       Code Review Slot A (<runtime>): <X>/<Y> (<percentage or n/a>)
       Code Review Slot B (<runtime>): <X>/<Y> (<percentage or n/a>)
       Fixer (<runtime>): <X>/<Y> (<percentage or n/a>)
     ```
   - For codex-only quests, explicitly show `Claude agents: 0/0 (n/a)` if no Claude entries exist.
   - If overall compliance is 100%:
     "All agents wrote handoff.json. Orchestrator routed via structured handoff files throughout."
   - If compliance is 75-99%:
     "Most agents complied. <list non-compliant agents>. Consider tweaking instructions for those agents."
   - If compliance is 50-74%:
     "Mixed compliance. Investigate non-compliant agents. Consider upgrading to run_in_background: true for native Claude Task agents."
   - If compliance is <50%:
      "Low compliance -- discard approach is not effective. Recommend upgrading to run_in_background: true."

6. **Create quest journal entry and archive** (automated via script):
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/quest_complete.py --quest-dir .quest/<id>
    ```
    This script handles all of the following automatically:
    - Creates `docs/quest-journal/<slug>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` with quest metadata, summary, files changed, iterations, agent credits, and an embedded `celebration_data` JSON block (for future `/celebrate` replay)
    - Inserts a row at the top of `docs/quest-journal/README.md` index table
    - Moves `.quest/<id>/` to `.quest/archive/<id>/`

    The script reads all quest artifacts (state.json, handoff files, quest_brief.md, plan.md, reviews) and computes quality tier, achievements, and metrics automatically.

    **If the script fails**, fall back to manual creation:
    - Write journal entry manually following the format in existing entries
    - Move quest directory to archive manually

    **Idea file cleanup** (manual, after script runs):
    - If quest originated from an idea file:
      - Quote the original idea content under "This is where it all began..."
      - Remove the idea file (e.g., `ideas/my-idea.md`)
      - Add a `done` row to `ideas/README.md` index: `| done | ~~idea-slug~~ | One-line pitch. See [journal](../docs/quest-journal/slug_date.md). |`

7. **Verify archival:**
    - Confirm `.quest/archive/<id>/` exists
    - Confirm `.quest/<id>/` no longer exists
    - `.quest/` root should only contain active quests, `archive/`, and `audit.log`

8. **Next steps suggestion:**
    ```
    If vcs_available: Review changes with git diff; commit with git add -p && git commit
    If no VCS: Review files directly and initialize git only if you want versioned follow-up work
    ```
    - **Draft PR:** use `.skills/pr-assistant/SKILL.md` (preserve any existing bot-managed PR sections when editing PR body)
    - **PR review gate:** post an explicit review comment on the draft/ready PR, then merge only after NIT filtering using `AGENTS.md` rubric (readability-first, KISS/YAGNI/SRP/DRY, simple robust over complex elegance, avoid mocking-hell)

9. **Context reset suggestion:**
    ```
    Quest complete. Consider running /clear before your next quest to reset context.
    ```

10. **Check for Quest updates:**
   After the quest completes, check if a Quest update is available (if enough time has passed since the last check).

   **Configuration:**
   - Read `update_check` from `.ai/allowlist.json`:
     - `enabled` (default: true) - set to false to disable update checks
     - `interval_days` (default: 7) - minimum days between checks

   **Logic:**
   ```bash
   # Check for Quest updates (after completion)
   ALLOWLIST_FILE=".ai/allowlist.json"
   LAST_CHECK_FILE=".quest-last-check"
   NOW=$(date +%s)

   # Read config (default enabled=true, interval=7)
   UPDATE_ENABLED=$(jq -r '.update_check.enabled // true' "$ALLOWLIST_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
   INTERVAL_DAYS=$(jq -r '.update_check.interval_days // 7' "$ALLOWLIST_FILE" 2>/dev/null)

   if [ "$UPDATE_ENABLED" != "false" ]; then
     INTERVAL_SECONDS=$((INTERVAL_DAYS * 24 * 60 * 60))
     SHOULD_CHECK=true

     if [ -f "$LAST_CHECK_FILE" ]; then
       LAST_CHECK=$(cat "$LAST_CHECK_FILE")
       if [ $((NOW - LAST_CHECK)) -lt $INTERVAL_SECONDS ]; then
         SHOULD_CHECK=false
       fi
     fi

     if $SHOULD_CHECK; then
       if [ -f "scripts/quest_installer.sh" ] && [ -f ".quest-version" ]; then
         LOCAL_SHA=$(cat .quest-version 2>/dev/null || echo "")
         UPSTREAM_SHA=$(git ls-remote "https://github.com/KjellKod/quest.git" "refs/heads/main" 2>/dev/null | cut -f1)

         if [ -n "$LOCAL_SHA" ] && [ -n "$UPSTREAM_SHA" ] && [ "$LOCAL_SHA" != "$UPSTREAM_SHA" ]; then
           echo ""
           echo -n "Quest update available. Update now? [Y/n] "
           read -r response
           if [ "$response" != "n" ] && [ "$response" != "N" ]; then
             ./scripts/quest_installer.sh
           fi
         fi
         echo "$NOW" > "$LAST_CHECK_FILE"
       fi
     fi
   fi
   ```

   **Behavior:**
   - If `update_check.enabled` is `false`, skip entirely
   - If `.quest-last-check` exists and is recent (within `interval_days`), skip (no network call)
   - Compare local `.quest-version` SHA with upstream via `git ls-remote`
   - If different, prompt: "Quest update available. Update now? [Y/n]"
   - If user accepts (Y or Enter), run the installer
   - Update `.quest-last-check` with current timestamp (regardless of update availability)
   - Network errors are silently ignored (graceful degradation)

## Q&A Loop Pattern (Claude runtime only in normal operation)

Normal rule:
- Codex paths do not enter direct human Q&A. On timeout they fall back to Claude immediately; on other failures they retry once then fall back to Claude.
- Human Q&A is used when a Claude runtime role returns `STATUS: needs_human` (native `Task(...)` or bridge-invoked Claude).

If a Claude role returns `STATUS: needs_human`:

1. Extract questions from the response (text before `---HANDOFF---`) -- this is an intentional, bounded content read for human interaction, similar to Step 3.5
2. Present questions to user
3. Collect answers
4. Re-invoke the same agent with answers appended to context, referencing the same artifact paths
5. Repeat until agent returns `complete` or `blocked`

---

## State File Format

`.quest/<id>/state.json`:

```json
{
  "quest_id": "feature-x_2026-02-02__1430",
  "slug": "feature-x",
  "phase": "plan | plan_reviewed | presenting | presentation_complete | building | reviewing | fixing | complete",
  "status": "pending | in_progress | complete | blocked",
  "vcs_available": true,
  "branch": "quest/feature-x",
  "branch_mode": "branch | worktree | none",
  "worktree_path": "/absolute/path/to/worktree or null",
  "plan_iteration": 2,
  "fix_iteration": 0,
  "last_role": "arbiter_agent",
  "last_verdict": "approve | iterate",
  "created_at": "2026-02-02T14:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-02-02T14:45:00Z"
}
```

## Subagent Prompt Patterns

### Agent-to-Tool Mapping

| Role | Allowlist Key | Default | Runtime |
|------|---------------|---------|---------|
| Planner | `models.planner` | `claude` | Claude runtime or Codex per config |
| Plan Reviewer A | `models.plan-reviewer-a` | `claude` | Claude runtime or Codex per config |
| Plan Reviewer B | `models.plan-reviewer-b` | `gpt-5.5` | Claude runtime or Codex per config |
| Arbiter | `models.arbiter` | `claude` | Claude runtime or Codex per config |
| Builder | `models.builder` | `gpt-5.5` | Codex or Claude runtime per config |
| Code Reviewer A | `models.code-reviewer-a` | `claude` | Claude runtime or Codex per config |
| Code Reviewer B | `models.code-reviewer-b` | `gpt-5.5` | Claude runtime or Codex per config |
| Fixer | `models.fixer` | `gpt-5.5` | Codex or Claude runtime per config |

All role-to-model assignments are read from `.ai/allowlist.json` → `models`. The defaults above apply when a key is missing. **Model diversity** in review phases gives independent perspectives from different model families. If roles are executed through Codex-backed tools, runtime attribution in `context_health.log` must record `codex`.

### Codex MCP Prompt Pattern

**IMPORTANT:** Keep Codex prompts SHORT. Point to files, let Codex read them. Prefer the context digest over full docs.

```markdown
You are the <ROLE>.

Read your instructions: .skills/quest/agents/<role>.md

Optional (full mode only, if needed): .skills/BOOTSTRAP.md, AGENTS.md

Quest brief: .quest/<id>/quest_brief.md
<other relevant files as paths>

<specific task instruction>

Write output to: .quest/<id>/<path>
Write handoff file to: .quest/<id>/<phase>/handoff.json

When done, output:
---HANDOFF---
STATUS: complete | needs_human | blocked
ARTIFACTS: <files written>
NEXT: <next role or null>
SUMMARY: <one line>
---
```

**Why short prompts?**
- Codex has file access — it can read what it needs
- Large inline prompts cause timeouts and context issues
- Agents should do **targeted** exploration guided by the quest brief/plan (avoid full-repo inventory)
- The digest captures stable context and reduces repeated reads

---

## Performance: Codex MCP Latency

Codex MCP calls can be slower when each run must:
1. Read multiple files (role instructions, digest, quest brief, plan)
2. Analyze the content
3. Write output file

**To speed up Codex reviews**, use the allowlist review controls:
- `review_mode: fast` → shorter prompts, max 5 bullets
- `review_mode: auto` → fast for small diffs, full for large
- `review_mode: full` → always full context
- `fast_review_thresholds` → tune size cutoff

**Simplification options:**
- Use the context digest instead of full docs
- Remove "Read your instructions:" and give inline instructions instead
- Ask for bullet points instead of full review

**Example minimal prompt:**
```
mcp__codex__codex(
  model: <models.plan-reviewer-b from allowlist>,
  prompt: "Review .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/plan.md

  List any issues (max 5 bullets). Write to .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_plan-reviewer-b.md

  End with: ---HANDOFF--- STATUS: complete ARTIFACTS: .quest/<id>/phase_01_plan/review_plan-reviewer-b.md NEXT: arbiter SUMMARY: <one line>"
)
```

**Tradeoff:** Simpler prompts = faster but less thorough review.

## Error Handling

- If an agent fails to produce a handoff: Extract any artifacts from the response, log the error, ask user how to proceed
- If a bridge-invoked Claude role times out: retry once; if it times out again, treat the step as blocked and surface the timeout
- If a bridge-invoked Claude role fails due to CLI/auth/environment problems: block immediately and tell the user how to repair the local Claude bridge
- If a bridge-invoked Claude role fails with malformed output or missing handoff: retry once with a strict reminder, then use text handoff fallback if possible; otherwise block
- If Codex MCP times out: fall back to equivalent Claude role immediately (no retry — timeouts rarely recover on retry)
- If Codex MCP fails (non-timeout): retry once with strict non-interactive reminder; if failure persists, fall back to equivalent Claude role; ask user only if fallback also cannot proceed
- If max iterations reached: Stop, show current state, ask user for guidance
- If artifact file missing after agent run: Try to extract from response text and write it
