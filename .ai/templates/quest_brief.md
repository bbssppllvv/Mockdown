# Quest Brief: <QUEST_SLUG>

## Summary
<!-- One paragraph describing what this quest accomplishes -->

## Motivation
<!-- Why is this needed? What problem does it solve? -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Numbered list of concrete, testable criteria -->
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

## Constraints
<!-- Any limitations, non-goals, or boundaries -->
- ...

## Relevant Context
<!-- Links to architecture docs, related plans, existing code -->
- ...

## Notes
<!-- Optional: anything the Creator wants the agents to know -->

## Router Classification

<!-- The orchestrator records the full router JSON here at quest creation. Downstream agents read this block to decide which conditional skills to load — e.g. `ux-context` when `ui_work: true`. -->

```json
{
  "route": "<workflow|solo|manual|questioner>",
  "confidence": "<0.0..1.0>",
  "risk_level": "<low|medium|high>",
  "complexity": "<trivial|moderate|substantial>",
  "ui_work": "<true|false>",
  "ui_work_evidence": [],
  "reason": "<one-sentence justification>",
  "missing_information": []
}
```

<!-- Placeholders MUST be overwritten by the orchestrator at quest creation. A brief that still contains `<...>` literal markers in this block is a contract violation. Downstream agents must treat `ui_work` as true only when the parsed JSON value is the boolean `true`; missing values, placeholder strings, and `"true"` string values are false and should be reported as malformed router data. -->
